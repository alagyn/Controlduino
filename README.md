# Controlduino
An XBox controller emulator for use with non-native-USB Arduinos (Nano etc)

If you have an Arduino that has native-USB capabilities, this project would better suit you.
[ArduinoXInput](https://github.com/dmadison/ArduinoXInput)

Despite not having plug-and-play capability, you can still use an Arduino such as the Nano to make your own custom USB game controllers.
Controlduino connects to your Arduino using low-level Serial communications and converts it into an emulated XBox360 controller.
